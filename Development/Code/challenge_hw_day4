# Now that you know how the yield method works, try to write your
# own version of the each method without using the each method
# provided by ruby. As in, try to build my_each using only the
# while keyword.
 
# Think about what's going on in each, if it's looping through
# the elements of an array and yielding you the individual
# element one at a time to your block. What has to happen
# to do this?
 
# Note: All ruby methods accept blocks by default.

def my_each(array)
  i = 0
  n = array.length

  n.times do
  yield i
  i += 1
  end
end
